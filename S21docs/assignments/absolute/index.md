# The ablative absolute

Review the slides from last Wednesday's class introducing the absolute.    

Create a file in your github repository named "absolute.md", and analyze the following selections from Hyginus as follows.

**1**. Identify verbal units: 
    - clauses (dependent and independent)
    - indirect statements 
    - participial expressions.  Indicate levels of subordination indented, as we have done before.

**2**. Then, for each participle, write:

    1. find the noun or pronoun it agrees with in gender, case number
    2. identify the tense and voice of the participle


**3**. Look for clues in the narrative and in the language of the passage to help you choose *one* English clause to translate the participle.  Be prepared to discuss in class why you preferred one specific translation; were others possible?


## Passages from Hyginus

**Hyginus 30pr.3**  This passage is from Hercules' canonical twelve labors:  he slew the many-headed Hydra.

*Hercules Hydram Minerua monstrante interfecit.*


**38pr.3**  We looked in class at the story of Procrustes, who chopped off the body of his guests to fit the size of the bed they were offered.

*Procrustes erat Neptuni filius. ad hunc hospes cum venisset, minori lecto proposito, reliquam corporis partem praecidebat.*



**40pr.4** Pasiphae was the wife of Minos, king of Crete.  Juno made Pasiphae fall in love with a bull (!) -- but in reality if was Daedalus in a bull costume (!!).  Minos punished Daedalus when he found out.

*Minos re cognita Daedalum in custodiam coniecit*

**54pr.4**  Prometheus was chained to a rock on Mount Caucasus where an eagle ate his liver every day. Prometheus alone knew of an oracle that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father.  When Jupiter was going to sleep with Thetis, Prometheus made a deal with him:  in exchange for telling Jupiter about the oralce, Jupiter would free Prometheus.  Jupiter agreed, and sent Hercules to set Prometheus free.

*aquila interfecta Prometheus post ⅩⅩⅩ annos de monte Caucaso est solutus*


**68pr.1**  Eteocles and Polynices, two sons of Oedipus, each claimed the throne of Thebes after the death of their father.  Polynices led a force of seven generals to attack Thebes where Eteocles was in power.

*Polynices Adrasto rege adiuuante cum septem ductoribus Thebas uenit*


**3pr**  The story of the Golden Fleece gets off to a weird start even by mythological standards.  Phrixus was instructed to ride a golden ram to the land of Colchis, and sacrifice it to Mars.  At the temple of Mars, the golden skin was guarded by a dragon.  Jason and the Argonauts later sailed to Colchis to bring the Golden Fleece back.


*Phrixus arietem immolauit pellemque eius inauratam in templo Martis posuit quam seruante dracone Iason Aesonis et Alcimedis filius dicitur petisse.*
