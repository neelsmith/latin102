# Reviewing noun-adjective agreement



## Background: thematic noun lists

More than 75 nouns appear 15 or more times in Hyginus.  That's too many for us to learn at one sitting, so we'll break the  nouns into thematic groups, such as "family terms", "animals", "warfare" or anything else you would find helpful.


## 1. Defining a theme

Define a theme of your choosing that includes at least four nouns in the [list of most frequent nouns in Hyginus](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/vocabulary/nouns).


List the nouns belonging to your theme in the file `nouns1.md` that we created together in class.
