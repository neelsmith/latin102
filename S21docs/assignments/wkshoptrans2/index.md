# Reviewing participles


1. Find all participles in the passage from Hyginus 34 included in your second [translation](../../checklist/translation2/) assignment.  Identify each participle (gender, number, case, tense and voice).
2.  You should find four participles in the final sentence of the passage (beginning *ille moriens...*)!  Analyze this sentence following the instructions for the translation assignment: place each verbal idea (clause, indirect statement, participial expression) on a separate line, indented to show its level of subordination. Italicize the verb of each unit by surrounding it with asterisks.
3. Be prepared to suggest a most approrpiate idea to translate each participle with.
