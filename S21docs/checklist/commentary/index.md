# Commenting on Latin reading

You may choose either option **A** or option **B**



## Option A


As you did in translation 2, please select **two choices of syntax, word order, or diction** that Hyginus makes from anywhere in your Latin reading, and comment briefly on how Hyginus' choice complements or enhances the meaning of the passage’s content. 

Discuss briefly: no  more than 2-4 sentences for each example. Italicize Latin words when citing them.

You may select examples from anything you have looked at in Hyginus, from the narrative of his 12 deeds in chapter 30, or the story of his death in chapter 36.



## Option B

Compare a passage of Hyginus with an illutration of the same subject in art.  Identify the work of art, and cite at least two specific points in Hyginus' Latin that are similar to or different from the visual illustration.
