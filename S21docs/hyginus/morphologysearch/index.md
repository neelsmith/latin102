# Morphological search

Select an analytical type from pop-up menu, and set values for one or more morphological properties to limit your results.

In the current version, morphological properties are associated with individual *tokens* ("words"), so compound forms (e.g., all forms of the perfect passive system) are not recognized.  A better version would group these tokens together to form a single token.
