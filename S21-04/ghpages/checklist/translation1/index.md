## Passage to analyze

(Based on Hyginus, chapter 33.)

Highlighting <span class='query'>like this</span> indicates words or phrases referred to in the following grammatical questions.

> Hercules cum in hospitium ad <span class='query'>Dexamenum</span> regem <span class='query'>uenisset</span> eiusque filiam <span class='query'>Deianiram</span> deuirginasset, volebat eam uxorem ducere.  cum Hercules <span class='query'>abesset</span>,  centaurus Eurytion petit Deianiram uxorem. quia pater eius centaurum timebat, <span class='query'>pollicitus est</span> se daturum.

><span class='query'>Tempore certo</span>, venit centaurus cum fratribus ad nuptias. Hercules interuenit et centaurum interfecit, Deianiram <span class='query'>abduxit</span>.




## A. Grammatical analysis

Place each clause on a separate line, indented to show its level of subordination.  Italicize the verb of each clause by surrounding it with asterisks. For example, if you were given the English sentence, "They felt relieved when they realized that the translation was easy.", you could write that in markdown as

```julia
They *felt* relieved
> when they *realized*
>> that the translation *was* easy. 
```

and it would be formatted as

`They` *felt* `relieved`
> `when they` *realized*
>> `that the translation` *was* `easy`.



## B. Grammatical questions

1. Write a dictionary entry (nominative singular, genitive singular, gender) for *Dexamenum*, then identify the form *Dexamenum*.
1. Write a dictionary entry (nominative singular, genitive singular, gender) for *Deianiram*, then identify the form *Deianiram*.
1. Identify the form *abesset*, and explain why it is this tense and mood.
1. Identify the form *uenisset*, and explain why it is this tense and mood.
1. Identify the form *pollicitus est*.  What dictionary form would you look under to find this verb?
1. Identify the form of the noun-adjective phrase *tempore certo*, and explain why it is in this case.

## C. Translation

Please translate the passgae into idiomatic English.
