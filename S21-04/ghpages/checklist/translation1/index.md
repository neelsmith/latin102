## A. Grammatical analysis

Place each clause on a separate line, indented to show its level of subordination.  Italicize the verb of each clause. For example, if you were given the English sentence, "They felt relieved when they realized that the translation was easy.", you would format it as

`They` *felt* `relieved`

> `when they` *realized*

>> `that the translation` *was* `easy`.
