## Vocabulary

Our semester-long goal is to master the short vocabulary list of about 240-250 items [listed here](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/vocabulary/).  These vocabulary items account for almost 3/4 all words in the reading selections in Hyginus' *Fabulae* that we will turn to April! Many of the remaining 25% or so are personal names.

We will take small sets of the vocabulary each week, so that by early April, you will be in command of the whole list.  When we then turn to continuous reading of unaltered passages of Hyginus, you will recognize most of the words you see.
