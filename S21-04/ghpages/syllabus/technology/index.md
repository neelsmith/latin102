Zoom
We’ll use Zoom for group meetings, including regularly scheduled class meetings. If you’re comfortable doing so, please do turn your video on: seeing faces can help create a sense of connection, and can encourage us to engage with each other. Tailoring your Zoom preferences with individual image, name, and (if your system supports it) virtual background is encouraged!

In full class meetings, please keep your microphone muted when not speaking, so we don’t get feedback from 20 audio inputs. I won’t be able to see everyone at once, so keep the chat stream open, and drop a note there when you’d like to chime in. Do feel free as well to use Zoom reactions (“thumbs up”), or gesture in your video as well: if you’re in my Zoom grid, those are sometimes easier to see than the chat stream.

github
Github is the world’s most widely used service for hosting projects with version control – tracking drafts and modifications to documents. We’ll use github to work on drafts of your portfolio assignments. Every github repository also includes the option of hosting a free web site on github.io, so you’ll have the choice of sharing your entire portfolio or selections from it on a publicly visible website. This can be valuable beyond Latin 101: many employers now are accustomed to finding a link to a github site as a standard part of job applications.

You’ll need to set up a (free) account on github, and include your user name in the brief informational form you’ll complete at the beginning of the semester. Choose your user name thoughtfully. Six months from now, you don’t want to send out a résumé with a github link to jackass593.
