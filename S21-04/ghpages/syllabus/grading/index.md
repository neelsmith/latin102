# Course requirements and grading


You will determine your own course grade this semester. We will use specification grading, a system that makes criteria for earning course points explicit in a shared rubric, in a series of repeatable assignments.  One goal of this approach is to make
course requirements simultaneously rigorous and attainable.

Requirements for individual assignments are specified in the instructions for each assignment.  A *satisfactory* grade means that *all* requirements are satisfied.  On a quiz, for example, this means that 100% of questions are correctly answered.  If you miss an answer, you will have the option of coming to drop-in hours to explain your corrections, and receive credit for a *satisfactory* grade.


## Basis for course grades

Your course grade will be determined by a combination of assignments graded *complete/incomplete*, and assignments earning a specified number of points.  


### Requirements graded *complete/incomplete*

Four assignments will be graded *complete* or *incomplete*:

1. completing initial course information form
2. CBL lab attendance
3. completing CBL lab project
4. 2-3 reflective questionnaires

### Assignments earning points

 You will have three series of written assignments, with each series comprising a quiz, a translation exercise, and a Latin composition (a total of nine assignments).  Deadlines for initial submission and last date for revision are [listed here](../../checklist/).


**First series**.   Each assignment in the first series is worth a maximum of **three points**, determined as:

 - 1 point if submitted on time
 - 1 point if a satisfactory (perfect) score is completed before the deadline for "last date for revisions"
 - 1 point if a satisfactory (perfect) score is submitted before the end of the semester

 This means that if you achieve a satisfactory (perfect) score with an on-time first submission, you immediately earn 3 points (because the first submission is on time, is before the last date for submission, and is a perfect score).

**Second and third series**.  In the next two series, each assignment is worth two points each:  1 point if submitted on time, 1 point if a satisfactory (perfect) score is submitted before the deadline for "last date for revisions".

**Commentary/response assignment** In the last section of the course, when we are reading Hyginus continuously, you will complete a final assignment responding to the text. This assignment is worth two points.



### Submitting and revising work

You will post your submissions to your github repository where I can read and share comments with you. (You will have the option of using github to host your entire portfolio or selections from it on a personal web site.)  

You may revise an assignment first coming to my drop-in hours, and explaining orally how to correct any errors on your initial submission.



## Determination of course grades

There are four requirements graded *complete/incomplete*.  Other assignments can earn as many as 23 points total:

| Assignments | Value | Total |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First series | 3 @3 points | 9 |
| Second series | 3 @2 points | 6 |
| Third series | 3 @2 points | 6 |
| Commentary/response | 1 @2 points | 2 |
| | **Total possible points**  | **23** |


I will use this chart to record the grade you have earned for the course.


| Letter grade     | Minimum points     | Minimum complete/incomplete |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| A       | 23 | 4 |
| A- | 	22 | 4|
| B+ | 	21  | 4 |
| B	 | 19  | 3|
| B- | 	18  |   3 |
| C+ | 	17  | 3 |
| C	 | 15| 3|
| C- | 	14 | 2 |
