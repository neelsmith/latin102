# Welcome back!

We'll warm up in our first class using verbs, nouns and prepositions.


## Questions to review

Can you identify:

- what do each of the three items in the dictionary form for a noun mean? Example:
    -  *filius, filii* (m.)
- what three pieces of information fully identify the form of a noun?  Example:
    -  *filiorum*
- what do each of the four items in the dictionary form for a verb mean? Example:
    -  *dico, dicÄ•re, dixi, dictus*
- what five pieces of information fully identify the form of a verb?  Example:
    - *dixit*



## Vocabulary to review

The dictionary form for a preposition has only two pieces of information: the (unchanging) form, and the case of the noun used with it.  For example, an entry like

> *per* + acc.

means that nouns used with the preposition *per* are in the *accusative* case.  To express the idea "throughout the night" (*nox, noctis*, f.), you could use the phrase *per noctem*.

Here is a list of all the [prepositions used frequently in Hyginus](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/vocabulary/prepositions/).  Review the list, and try the interactive exercise below.
