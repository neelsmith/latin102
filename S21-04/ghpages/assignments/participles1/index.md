# Introduction to participles

Participles are adjectives made from verbs.  Like every Latin adjective, they agree in gender, case and number with the noun they describe, but they express a verbal idea that also has tense and voice!

English makes very limited use of participles.  Consider these two sentences.

> Each year, Gallup compiles a list of most *admired* people.
>
> *Admiring* crowds flocked to the Botanical Garden to see the seasonal blooms.

The word *admired* is an adjective describing *people* (What kind of people does Gallup list? *admired people*.)  

The word *Admiring* is an adjective describing *crowds*.  (What kind of crowds came? *admiring* crowds.)

Both are formed from the English verb "to admire".  *Admired* is passive voice: the people Gallup lists are being admired (they receive the action of "to admire").   *Admiring* is active voice:  the crowds actively admire the blossoms (they perform the action of "to admire").

You already learn one participle when you learn principle parts of the verb:  the fourth principle part is a participle that is *passive* voice, and *perfect* tense.  (Now you know that technically the perfect passive tense is formed by combining the perfect passive participle with forms of the verb *sum*.) 

## Participles in Latin

Latin uses participles frequently, and can connect a noun to the circumstances in many different ways. Often, these are similar to other dependent verbal constructions corresponding to a dependent clause in English translation.   Examples include:

- participles can indicate relations of *time* or *circumstance* (similar to a temporal clause)
- participles can *identify* a person or thing (similar to a relative clause)
- participles can suggest a *causal* relation (like an English clause beginning "because...)
- participles can suggest a *concessive* relation (like English "although...")


 Let's look at a story in Hyginus using the first-conjugation verb  *delasso, delassare, delassavi, delassatus/a/um*, "to tire (someone) out."  The giant Antaeus used to force visitors to wrestle with him; he would exhaust them, then kill them. (He got his turn when he tried to pull this trick on Hercules: Hyginus, chapter 31.)  First, a sentence with no participles:

> *Hospites delassabantur, et Antaeus eos interficiebat.*
>
> The visitors would be exhausted (passive voice), and Antaeus would kill them.

Now let's look at how Hyginus phrases that:


> Antaeus hospites delassatos interficiebat.

*delassatos* is masculine, accusative, plural, agreeing with *hospites*, the direct object of the verb: "Antaeus used to kill the visitors."  It is passive voice, and perfect tense:  the visitors are identified as having already been worn out before Antaeus killed them.  How should we interpret it?  Here are some possibilities:


**Time**:  "After the guests were exhausted, Antaeus killed them." (Since it's perfect tense, we know they were exhausted before Antaeus killed them.)

**Circumstance**:  "Once the guests were exhausted, Antaeus killed them."

**Identification**: "Antaeus killed the guests, who were exhausted."

**Causation**:  "Because the guests were exhausted, Antaeus killed them." 

**Concession**: "Although the guests were exahausted, Antaeus killed them."

How can we decide among all these possibilities??  As we've been emphaiszing all year, we need to read in context.  In this story the last two options make no sense. Antaeus deliberately exhausted the guests, in order to kill them:  he didn't kill them because they were tired!  And he certainly didn't kill them despite the fact that they were tired!

In another context, however, those might be good options for translating the perfect participle of *delasso*.  Here are examples that you could easily interpret as causal:

> *Delassati nolebant laborare.*
>
> Because they were exhausted, they were unwilling to work.

> *Delassati non poterant profugere.*
>
> Because they were exhausted, they were unable to escape. 


For a concessive idea, consider this:

> *Ulixes delassatus tamen iuvenes volebat servare.*
>
> "Although he was exhausted, Ulysses nevertheless wanted to save the youths."



## Translating participles

<div class="warningdiv">
<span class="giant">⚠️</span>
<p>
Because Latin uses participles so differently from English, <b>do not translate Latin participles with
English participles</b>!
</p>
<p>Instead, look at the context, and choose the type of English dependent (subordinate) clause that you think best captures the connection of the participle to the meaning of the sentence
