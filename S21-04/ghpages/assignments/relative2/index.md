# Practice with relative clauses


Find the relative pronoun in each sentence, identify its gender, case and number, and find its antecedent.  When you've correctly identified these, try to translate the sentence. (If you dont' remember a vocabulary items, you should be able to find everything except proper names in the semester-long Latin 102 [vocabulary list](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/vocabulary/).)


(Because the selection from the list of sentences is genuinely random, it's possible for the same sentence to come up twice in a row:  just click again to make another random choice.)
