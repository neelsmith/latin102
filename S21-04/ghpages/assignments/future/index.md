# The future indicative

The future indicative tense expresses a confident statement that something *will* happen in the future.  The future tense exists only in the indicative: there is not future subjunctive.

The future tense is built on the same stem as the present and imperfect tenses, which you find by looking at the first two principal parts.  (Another way of saying this:  the present, imperfect and future tenses belong to the *present system* of verb tenses in Latin.)

The way you form the future depends on the conjugation the verb belongs to.  (Recall that you can determine the conjugation from the present infintive:  the second principal part.)  


## Future in first two conjugations

In the first two conjugations, you extend the stem with `b` plus the vowel `o` (in the first singular), `u` (in the third plural) or  `i` (in all the other forms), and add the same endings for person/number/voice as always.  This is similar to the way you form the imperfect tense (which also exists only in the indicative).  Compare these forms.



| Person, number, voice | Future | Imperfect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| third singular active | amabit | amabat |
| third singular passive | amabitur | amabatur |
| third plural active | amabunt | amabant |
| third plural passive | amabuntur | amabantur |
| third singular active | habebit | habebat |
| third singular passive | habebitur | habebatur |
| third plural active | habebunt | habebant |
| third plural passive | habebuntur | habebantur |



## Future in the third and fourth conjugations

In the third, third-io and fourth conjugations, the future stem is modified by adding the vowel `e` (third conjugation) or `ie` (third-io and fourth), and applying the familiar endings for person/number/voice.

(This applies to all forms except the first singular: the first singular endings are `am` for the active voice and `ar` for the passive voice.)

Since the endings are identical, it is important to pay attention to the differences in the vowels of the present indicative, present subjunctive and future indicative.  Compare these third singular forms.

| Voice | Present indicative | Present subjunctive | Future indicative | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| active | ducit | ducat | ducet |
| passive | ducitur | ducatur | ducetur |
| active | capit | capiat | capiet |
| passive | capitur | capiat | capiet |
| active | audit | audiat | audiet |
| passive | auditur | audiatur | audietur |

## Practice identifying forms

Enter your answer formatted as `verb`: `person number tense mood voice`.  Enter the first principal part for the verb, and spell out the values for each part of the identification.

**Example**:  if you were given `facit`, you would enter

> `facio: third singular present indicative active`
