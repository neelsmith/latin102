# Goals

Latin 102 is the continuation of Latin 101.  We will use a curriculum recently developed by several members of our Classics department at Holy Cross, led by [Professor Machado](https://dominicmachado.github.io). By the end of this course, you will be able to:

  - identify ways that  language structures our understanding of the world we live in
  - articulate how Latin has shaped and continues to shape structures of power in the modern world
  - read and pronounce Latin with confidence and accuracy
  - analyze syntax and sentence structure in Latin and English
  - express complex ideas in written composition both in Latin and in English
  - read authentic, unaltered Latin texts with minimal glossing




# Community-based learning

Community-based learning (CBL) is an essential part of our course. In this part of the course, you will work under the supervision of a mentor with elementary and middle schoolers in Worcester and Marlborough on collaborative projects about the texts we are reading. (Note that we have already developed a curriculum you can use in this work).

You should anticipate spending roughly two hours per week (including travel) on the CBL part of your course.  We have included that time in our course plans as part of the 8-10 hours weekly  that Holy Cross expects students to devote to work outside of our 150 minutes of meeting time.

Scheduling for off-campus work will be coordinated in conjunction with the CBL office during the first week of class.




# Course material

 1. All course material will be available on the **course web site** at [https://neelsmith.github.io/latin102/](https://neelsmith.github.io/latin102/).
 2. Written assignments will be submitted in **Canvas**.

## Textbook: REWRITE THIS

The fall semester course is organized in three units. On our course website, each unit identifies concrete objectives that will help you achieve the broader course goals summarized above.  The three units correspond closely to the first three units of the online textbook we are revising for this year's course.  You can always find a current on-line version at [https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/).

In addition to introducing new features of Latin, each unit will include reading that connects the topics you are studying to contemporary experience, and will conclude with a reading selection from an authentic ancient text.  This year, our reading selections will be drawn from a mythological handbook attributed to Gaius Julius Hyginus.

The textbook also has an accompanying youtube channel and playlist at [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyA2aidE3BiD3idsxrJr5Hg/videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyA2aidE3BiD3idsxrJr5Hg/videos).




# What to expect

There are no prerequisites for this course, and no individual concept we are going to cover this semester is particularly complex, but Latin 101-102 is a fast-paced sequence. At the beginning of the course, *everything* will be new, and you should expect that the hardest part of the entire 101-102 sequence will be the first few weeks before fall break, because everything will be new.  Our course is organized so that these weeks introduce the  most frequent features of the language, so as you constantly reuse the material from the beginning of Latin 101, it will not only become increasingly automatic, but will give you a framework that will make it easier to learn further features of the language.

Some concepts may sink in immediately, and others may take more practice.  Review and practice are as important as your initial introduction to a topic, so every graded assignment offers you the opportunity to repeat it as often as you need in order to complete it satisfactorily.

Most of our class time together will be devoted to actively applying and using ideas from your class preparation. Since much of the value of this time results from your active engagement with course material, and cannot be replicated by passively watching someone else's involvement, I do not plan to record our class meetings.

## Tips

These practices will help you absorb material most effectively:

  - Schedule regular times both for newly assigned homework and review of previously covered material.
  - Spread your study across several days each week. Multiple, shorter sessions are better preparation than an equal amount of time in a single marathon.
  - Practice your Latin aloud. Vocalizing Latin and listening to yourself will help you progress more rapidly than reading silently.
  - When you are studying, focus only on Latin. Turn off your cell phone and any other electronic communications. Turn off any music: you should see, hear and speak only Latin.

## Work log

To help you gauge how effectively you are managing your work, I will ask you to keep a log of your work on Latin. You should note what days you worked on Latin and for how long.  You may also wish to note what kind of work you did: written homework, vocabulary review, or draft of a portfolio assignment, for example.

Your work logs will not be graded, but I will periodically ask you to summarize the number of days and hours per week you have worked on Latin, for anonymous submission. This will help me evaluate how to balance assignments as we progress through the year.




# Course requirements and grades

You determine your own course grade by satisfactorily completing a number of assignments in three categories:

 1. written assignments for class preparation
 2. longer portfolio assignments
 3. work in CBL lab

All assignments will be graded satisfactory/unsatisfactory according to an explicit specification of requirements: if you complete all requirements for an assignment, the assignment is satisfactory; otherwise, it is unsatisfactory.

## Class preparation

The course schedule includes fourteen brief assignments as part of your routine class preparation: one introductory Google form to complete, and thirteen  assignment to be submitted in writing. Each assignment can earn up to two points: one point for a completed *submission* by the specified deadline, and a second point for a grade of *satisfactory*. For written assignments, the deadline for initial submission 11:00 am on the due date, our class meeting time.

If you submit an assignment on time (earning one point), but have an error, you may resubmit a corrected version as often as you like up until the deadline for final revisions for that course unit. When a revised submission is satisfactory a second point will be recorded for that assignment.

The total points you can earn in this category is 28.

## Portfolio assignments

Over the course of the semester, you will develop a portfolio of nine longer assignments. Three of these will demonstrate mastery of basic features of language; three will be analyses and translations of passages in Latin; three  will be compositions in Latin.  Throughout the semester, we will set aside class meeting time to workshop drafts of these longer assignments.

As with class preparation assignments, each portfolio assignment earns one point for a complete submission on time, and a second point if it fulfills all the requirements for a satisfactory grade. For portfolio assignments, the deadline for initial submission any time on the due date.  Like class preparation assignments, portfolio assignments may be revised as often as you like up to the deadline for revisions for each module.

The total points you can earn in this category is 18.

## CBL lab

You will receive three grades for CBL lab work.

  - preparatory assignment:  one preparatory assignment ("Identify that character") can earn up to two points: one point for a completed submission by the deadline, and a second point for a grade of satisfactory.
  - participation: you will participate in a total of seven sessions with Worcester or Marlborough students.  Each session earns one point in this category.
  - reflection: one brief reflection can earn up to two points: one point for a completed submission by the deadline, and a second point for a grade of satisfactory.

The total points you can earn in this category is 11.

## Determination of final course grade

Your course grade will be recorded from this table.  In the row for each grade, the numbers in each column represent the *minimum* number of points required in that category. For example, if you earn 18 points in in the portfolio category, 11 points in the CBL category and 25 points in the class preparation category, your course grade is A-.

| Course grade | Portfolio (out of 18) | Class preparation (out of 28) | CBL  (out of 11) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | 18 | 26 |  11 |
| A- | 18 | 25 |  10 |
| B+ | 17 | 25 |  10 |
| B | 16 | 24 |  9|
| B- | 15 | 23 |   2 |
| C+ | 14 | 23 |   2 |
| C | 13 | 22 |  2  |
| C- | 12 | 21 |  2 |
| D | 11 | 20 |   0 |




# Policies

## Class attendance

Active participation in class is one of the most effective ways to learn Latin.  My expectations for your class attendance follow the college policies posted at [https://catalog.holycross.edu/requirements-policies/academic-policies/#coursepoliciestext](https://catalog.holycross.edu/requirements-policies/academic-policies/#coursepoliciestext).

If at some point in the semester you are unable to complete the required preparation for a single class, please come anyway: staying away only compounds the difficulty of catching up.  If you let me know that you're not prepared, I will not call on you in class.

If you are experiencing symptoms of a communicable disease, please let me know and do *not* come to class.  If you are are unable to attend class for whatever reason, for a shorter or longer period of time, please get in touch with me so we can work out a plan to get you caught up.

## Masking and testing

It is impossible to foresee how the ongoing global pandemic will develop this semester, and we continue to teach and learn in ways we did not anticipate. We will monitor the spread of the virus and re-evaluate our masking practices periodically throughout the semester.

Because even a "mild" case can have serious consequences for at-risk populations,  as the semester begins, medical-grade or better masks are required in class and in drop-in hours until further notice.

Masking is equally uncomfortable for us all, but feeling unsafe creates a poor learning environment so please do your part. Please continue to proactively monitor, test, and isolate at the onset of COVID-19 symptoms and close contact with any individuals with known infections. We will continue to closely monitor viral surges and current College recommendations in regards to COVID-19 and any other infectious diseases (e.g., monkeypox) that might emerge as we move through the semester.

## Diversity and Inclusivity

The study of the ancient Mediterranean world belongs to all of us: if you have chosen to study Latin, then you belong here. The diversity that our student body brings to this class is a resource, a strength and a shared benefit for all of us.

In developing this course, our aim has been to make the course materials and our interactions with each other respectful of diversity of all kinds: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture.  If you have suggestions about how to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups, please share them.

## Accommodations for disabilities

Any student who feels the need for accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact the Office of Disability Services to discuss support services available. The office can be reached by calling 508 793-3693 or by visiting Hogan Campus Center, room 215A.

If you are already registered with Disability Services, please let me know as soon as possible, so that I can take account of this in planning for tests or other course activities.

## Academic integrity

You should be familiar with the College’s policy on Academic Integrity posted at
[https://catalog.holycross.edu/requirements-policies/academic-policies/#academicintegritytext](https://catalog.holycross.edu/requirements-policies/academic-policies/#academicintegritytext)




# Peer tutoring

The Department of Classics and the Classics Department Inclusion Committee offer a peer-based tutoring program for Latin 101 students. The tutors have received training through Academic Services and Learning Resources, and can discuss course with ou, help you understand how to solve problems, and suggest independent learning strategies.

Tutoring workshops run as an appointment-based service of 40-minute sessions, at time arranged between you and the Peer Tutor. To set up an appointment with one of the tutors, please contact your professor.
