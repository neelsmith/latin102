# Goals

Latin 102 is the continuation of Latin 101.  We will use a curriculum recently developed by several members of our Classics department at Holy Cross, led by [Professor Machado](https://dominicmachado.github.io). By the end of this course, you will be able to:

  - identify ways that  language structures our understanding of the world we live in
  - articulate how Latin has shaped and continues to shape structures of power in the modern world
  - read and pronounce Latin with confidence and accuracy
  - analyze syntax and sentence structure in Latin and English
  - express complex ideas in written composition both in Latin and in English
  - read authentic, unaltered Latin texts with minimal glossing




# Community-based learning

Community-based learning (CBL) is an essential part of our course. In this part of the course, you will work under the supervision of a mentor with elementary and middle schoolers in Worcester and Marlborough on collaborative projects about the texts we are reading. (Note that we have already developed a curriculum you can use in this work).

You should anticipate spending roughly two hours per week (including travel) on the CBL part of your course.  We have included that time in our course plans as part of the 8-10 hours weekly  that Holy Cross expects students to devote to work outside of our 150 minutes of meeting time.

Scheduling for off-campus work will be coordinated in conjunction with the CBL office during the first week of class.




# Course material

 1. All course material will be available on the **course web site** at [https://neelsmith.github.io/latin102/](https://neelsmith.github.io/latin102/).
 2. We will draw reading and reference material from [this online textbook](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/).
 3. Written assignments will be submitted in **Canvas**.




# What to expect

This course builds directly on Latin 101. In the fall semester, you learned some of the most important, most distinctive and most frequent features of Latin. We covered that material at a fast pace -- and the winter break is long!  You will constantly reuse material from the fall semester, so it is important that you solidify your grasp of that material until you are confidently and readily able to apply it to your reading this spring.

We will introduce several new concepts in the weeks before Easter break.  Some may sink in immediately, and others may take more practice.  Review and practice are as important as your initial introduction to a topic, so every graded assignment offers you the opportunity to repeat it as often as you need in order to complete it satisfactorily.

After Easter, our class time will increasingly focus on reading of continuous passages of Hyginus' *Fabulae*. Throughout the semester, most of our class time together will be devoted to actively applying and using ideas from your class preparation. Since much of the value of this time results from your active engagement with course material, and cannot be replicated by passively watching someone else's involvement, I do not plan to record our class meetings.

## Tips

These practices will help you absorb material most effectively:

  - Schedule regular times both for newly assigned homework and review of previously covered material.
  - Spread your study across several days each week. Multiple, shorter sessions are better preparation than an equal amount of time in a single marathon.
  - Practice your Latin aloud. Vocalizing Latin and listening to yourself will help you progress more rapidly than reading silently.
  - When you are studying, focus only on Latin. Turn off your cell phone and any other electronic communications. Turn off any music: you should see, hear and speak only Latin.




# Course requirements and grades

You determine your own course grade by satisfactorily completing a number of assignments in these categories:

 1. portfolio assignments
 2. written assignments for class preparation
 3. in-class assessment of specific features of language or vocabulary
 4. CBL lab work

All assignments will be graded satisfactory/unsatisfactory according to an explicit specification of requirements: if you complete all requirements, the assignment is satisfactory.

Portfolio assignments, written homework assignments and in-class assessments may be repeated or revised as often as you like, up until a deadline for revisions thtat will be indicated on each assignment.  Normally, the deadline will be 3:00 pm on Friday of the following week.

## Portfolio assignments

Over the course of the semester, you will develop a portfolio of *up to 9* longer assignments. Three of these will demonstrate mastery of basic features of language by analyzing and explaining forms and constructions; three will be analyses and translations of passages in Greek; three  will be compositions in Greek.

Throughout the semester, we will set aside class meeting time to workshop drafts of these longer assignments.

Each portfolio assignment earns one point for a complete submission on time, and a second point if it fulfills all the requirements for a satisfactory grade by the deadline for revisions.  Portfolio assignments may be revised as often as you like, up to the deadline for revisions for each module.

The total points you can earn in this category are **18**.

## Written homework assignments

The course schedule will include *up to 6*  brief written assignments as part of your routine class preparation.  Each assignment can earn up to two points: one point for a completed *submission* by the specified deadline, and a second point for a grade of *satisfactory*.

The specifications for these assignments are straightforward: a submission is satisfactory if all responses are correct; an error means that the assignment is not satisfactory. If you submit an assignment on time (earning one point), but have an error, you may resubmit a corrected version as often as you like up until the deadline for final revisions for that module. When a revised submission is satisfactory a second point will be recorded for that assignment.

For written assignments, deadlines for submission are *3:00 pm* the day *before* class.

The total points you can earn in this category are **12**.

## In-class assessments

In addition to written preparation, we will have regular in-class assessments. *Up to 10* of these will focus on vocabulary; *up to 8* will focus on features of language or grammar.

In-class assessments will always be announced ahead of time, and we will always do at least one practice version together at least one class before we have a graded in-class assessment.

In-class assessments earn up to two points, one point for completing the assessment, and a second point if all answers are correct.  You may retake these assessments as often as you like up until the deadline for retakes.  You may not retake an assessment that you have missed for an unexcused class absence.

The total points you can earn in this category are **20** for vocabulary assessments and **16** for language assessments.

## CBL lab

Beginning in February, you will participate in *up to 8* weekly CBL labs. We will continue the mythology curriculum we used in the fall semester with students in Worcester and Marlborough public schools.

The total points you can earn in this category are **8**.

## Determination of final course grade

For each category, the preceding sections define the *maximum* number of assignments we will complete. If the daily course schedule changes and we instead work on fewer than the maximum number of assignments, you will receive full credit for any dropped assignments. For example, if we have 7 in-class language assessments instead of the maximum of 8, you will receive 2 points for the omitted assignment; that plus your points on the seven completed assignments would be your total for the semester in the category of language assessments.

Your course grade will be recorded from the following table.  In the row for each grade, the numbers in each column represent the minimum number of points required in that category.

| Course grade |  Portfolio (18) | Homework (12) | Vocab. assessments (20) | Language assessments  (16) | CBL participation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |--- |
| A |17 | 12 | 18 |  16 | 8|
| A- |17| 11 | 16 |  15 |  8 |
| B+ | 16 | 10| 16 | 14 | 8 |
| B | 15 | 10 | 16 | 13 | 7 |
| B- | 14 | 9 | 14 | 12 |7  |
| C+ | 14  | 9 | 13  | 12| 6  |
| C | 12 |  8  | 13 | 12 | 6 |
| C- | 12 | 8 | 12 | 12 | 5 |

# Policies

## Class attendance

Active participation in class is one of the most effective ways to learn Latin.  My expectations for your class attendance follow the college policies posted at [https://catalog.holycross.edu/requirements-policies/academic-policies/#coursepoliciestext](https://catalog.holycross.edu/requirements-policies/academic-policies/#coursepoliciestext).

If at some point in the semester you are unable to complete the required preparation for a single class, please come anyway: staying away only compounds the difficulty of catching up.  If you let me know that you're not prepared, I will not call on you in class.

If you are experiencing symptoms of a communicable disease, please let me know and do *not* come to class.  If you are are unable to attend class for whatever reason, for a shorter or longer period of time, please get in touch with me so we can work out a plan to get you caught up.

## Masking and testing

It is impossible to foresee how the ongoing global pandemic will develop this semester, and we continue to teach and learn in ways we did not anticipate. We will monitor the spread of the virus and re-evaluate our masking practices periodically throughout the semester.

Because even a "mild" case can have serious consequences for at-risk populations,  as the semester begins, medical-grade or better masks are required in class and in drop-in hours until further notice.

Masking is equally uncomfortable for us all, but feeling unsafe creates a poor learning environment so please do your part. Please continue to proactively monitor, test, and isolate at the onset of COVID-19 symptoms and close contact with any individuals with known infections. We will continue to closely monitor viral surges and current College recommendations in regards to COVID-19 and any other infectious diseases (e.g., monkeypox) that might emerge as we move through the semester.

## Diversity and Inclusivity

The study of the ancient Mediterranean world belongs to all of us: if you have chosen to study Latin, then you belong here. The diversity that our student body brings to this class is a resource, a strength and a shared benefit for all of us.

In developing this course, our aim has been to make the course materials and our interactions with each other respectful of diversity of all kinds: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture.  If you have suggestions about how to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups, please share them.

## Accommodations for disabilities

Any student who feels the need for accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact the Office of Disability Services to discuss support services available. The office can be reached by calling 508 793-3693 or by visiting Hogan Campus Center, room 215A.

If you are already registered with Disability Services, please let me know as soon as possible, so that I can take account of this in planning for tests or other course activities.

## Academic integrity

You should be familiar with the College’s policy on Academic Integrity posted at
[https://catalog.holycross.edu/requirements-policies/academic-policies/#academicintegritytext](https://catalog.holycross.edu/requirements-policies/academic-policies/#academicintegritytext)




# Peer tutoring

The Department of Classics and the Classics Department Inclusion Committee offer a peer-based tutoring program for Latin 101 students. The tutors have received training through Academic Services and Learning Resources, and can discuss course with ou, help you understand how to solve problems, and suggest independent learning strategies.

Tutoring workshops run as an appointment-based service of 40-minute sessions, at time arranged between you and the Peer Tutor. To set up an appointment with one of the tutors, please contact your professor.
