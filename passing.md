Passage to analyze
(Based on Hyginus, chapter 33.)

Highlighting like this indicates words or phrases referred to in the following grammatical questions.

Hercules cum in hospitium ad Dexamenum regem uenisset eiusque filiam Deianiram deuirginasset, volebat eam uxorem ducere. cum Hercules abesset, centaurus Eurytion petit Deianiram uxorem. quia pater eius centaurum timebat, pollicitus est se daturum.

Tempore certo, venit centaurus cum fratribus ad nuptias. Hercules interuenit et centaurum interfecit, Deianiram abduxit.

A. Grammatical analysis
Place each clause on a separate line, indented to show its level of subordination. Italicize the verb of each clause by surrounding it with asterisks. For example, if you were given the English sentence, “They felt relieved when they realized that the translation was easy.”, you could write that in markdown as

They *felt* relieved
> when they *realized*
>> that the translation *was* easy. 
and it would be formatted as

They felt relieved

when they realized

that the translation was easy.

B. Grammatical questions
Dexamenus, Dexameni (m) acc.s.
Deianira, Deianirae (f) acc.s.
3.s. imperfect subjunctive active.  Subjunctive because the temporal clause is emphasizing circumstance;  imperfect because we're in secondary sequence, and the event is the same time or later than the independent clause.
