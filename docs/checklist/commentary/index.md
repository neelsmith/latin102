# Commenting on Latin reading

As you did in translation 2, please select **two choices of syntax, word order, or diction** that Hyginus makes from anywhere in your Latin reading, and comment briefly on how Hyginus' choice complements or enhances the meaning of the passage’s content. 

Discuss briefly: no  more than 2-4 sentences for each example. Italicize Latin words when citing them.

You may select examples from anything you have looked at in Hyginus, from the narrative of his 12 deeds in chapter 30, or the story of his death in chapter 36.
