## Passage to analyze

(From Hyginus, chapter 34.)

Highlighting <span class='query'>like this</span> indicates words or phrases referred to in the following grammatical questions.

> Deianira, uxor Herculis, flumen magnum, <span class='query'>cui</span> nomen Evenus erat, non poterat <span class='query'>transire</span>, et centaurum Nessum, qui filius Ixionis et Nubis erat, auxilium rogavit.  Hic Deianiram <span class='query'>sublatam</span> in flumine ipso uiolare uoluit. huc Hercules cum interuenisset et Deianira cum fidem eius implorasset, Nessum <span class='query'>sagittis</span> confixit.

> ille <span class='query'>moriens</span>, cum sciret sagittas Hydrae Lernaeae <span class='query'>felle</span> <span class='query'>tinctas</span> magnam vim habere, sanguinem suum <span class='query'>exceptum</span> Deianirae dedit et id philtrum esse dixit.


## A. Grammatical analysis

Place each verbal idea (clause, indirect statement, participial expression) on a separate line, indented to show its level of subordination.  Italicize the verb of each unit by surrounding it with asterisks.



## B. Grammatical questions

1. Identify the antecedent of *cui*, and its gender and number. Then explain what case *cui* is, and how it functions in the relative clause. (I.e., why is *cui* in this case?)
2. Identify the form of *transire*.  Explain why you placed it in the clause you chose.
3. *sublatam* is from a verb that is a compound of *sub* plus a verb you should know very well.  Identify the form of this participle (which for participles means: gender, case, number, tense voice).  Find the dictionary entry for this word in thed [Lewis-Short's *Latin Dictionary*](http://folio2.furman.edu/lewis-short/index.html), and give its URN here.
4.  Identify the form of *sagittis*.  Why does Hyginus use this case?
5.  Identify the form of *moriens*.  
6.  Identify *felle*.  Why does Hyginus use this case?
7.  Identify the form of *tinctas*.
8.  Identify the form of *exceptum*.
9.  William Faulkner's novel *As I lay dying* takes its title from an English translation of a single word in *Odyssey* 11.424.  In Greek, where participles function very differently from English but similarly to Latin, that word is a present active participle.  Suggest one or more possible translations of Faulkner's title into Latin.
