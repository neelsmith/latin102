2. Centaurs *were being killed* by Hercules. (*Use the perfect tense*)
3. Centaurs *were killed* by Hercules. (*Use the perfect tense*)

5.  Hercules *led* Deianira in marriage (i.e., he married her).

<h3>Tips for formatting your quiz in markdown</h3>

<ul>
<li>separate paragraphs with an empty line</li>
<li>put list items on successive lines (no empty lines between items)
</li>
<li>for bulleted lists, start the line with `- `
</li>
<li>for numbered lists, start the line a number and a period.  (The markdown formatter will number items sequentially: you'll get the same results if you individually number each line, or start every line with `1.`.)</li>
</ul>
