# Composition 1: wives of Hercules

## Revising your composition

Some common questions that came up in work on composition 1:

- *to*.  When the English preposition "to" expresses the indirect object, Latin uses the dative case by itself.  If you want to express (sending something, travelling) "to a person", use the Latin preposition *ad*.  And one gotcha to note:  to travel *to* a city, Latin uses the accusative alone!  *volo Roman ire*, "I want to go *to* Rome."
- *since*.  The English conjunction "since" has a variety of shades of meaning.  In Latin, *quia* refers to a causal connection between its dependent clause and the clause it connects to.  In this composition, I think you want to emphasize the circumstances connecting the indepedent clause: don't forget that "since" can be a perfectly good translation of Latin *cum* with the subjunctive!
- *temporal clauses*.  If you're uncertain about what mood and tense you should choose for a temporal clause, refer to [this flow chart](../../imgs/sot.png) [<img src="../../imgs/sot.png" width="50"/>](../../imgs/sot.png).
- *indirect statement*. When you're composing indirect statemens, check that:
    1. you use an infinitive form of the verb
    2. you use the accusative case for the subject
    3. if the subject is the *same* as the subject of main verb, remember to use the reflexive pronoun *se* rather than a form of *is, ea, id*.
    4. if you are using a perfect passive infinitive or a future active infinitive, remember that since those compound infinitive forms are using the infinitive *esse* with an adjective, the adjective must agree in gender and number with the accusative subject of the infinitive.
- *Greek names*.  Like Latin, Greek nouns had cases, so Latin speakers often just used Greek nouns in their Greek form!  Iole is one of those names:  her nominative is *Iole*, her Greek accusative is *Iolen*; if you need to refer to her in another case in your composition, you should use a good Latin pronoun that you already know!

## Background story

(Based on chapter 35 of Hyginus)

> Heracles travelled to the city of Oechalia in Aetolia, and asked the king, Eurytus, for permission to marry his daughter, Iole.  When Eurytus refused, Heracles not only destroyed the city, but killed Iole's parents before her very eyes.  He then took Iole captive, and sent her to his home, to his wife Deianira (!)


## Instructions

 Using the story above as inspiration, compose a paragraph of Latin according to the instructions below. (DO NOT DIRECTLY TRANSLATE THE PARAGRAPH ABOVE.)

1. Your composition should use all the vocabulary items listed below at least once.
1. Your first sentence should use a temporal clause to express that when Hercules came to Oechalia, he asked to marry Iole.
2. Your second sentence should state that when her father Eurytus was unwilling, Hercules captured Oechalia.
3. Your third sentence should express that Hercules said that he would kill her parents, and should include an indirect statement.
4. Your fourth sentence should say that Iole endured that her parents were killed.
5. Your fifth statement should say that when he had killed all of them, he sent Iole to Deianira.


## Notes

 - *Iole* is a Greek name, and Hyginus uses the Greek form of her name in the accusative, *Iolen*.
