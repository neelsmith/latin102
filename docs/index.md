## Notes for reading


### Typical noun patterns

| Genitive | Nominative | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| -nt**is** | -ns | fons, fontis, m., "fountain, spring" |
| -on**is** | -o | draco, dracontis, m., "serpent, dragon" |

Remember this 2nd-declension pattern:  


| Genitive | Nominative | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| -r**i** | -er | aper, apri, m., "boar" |

### The pluperfect tense, active voice

*Formation*: looks like using the imperfect tense of *sum* as an ending on the third principal part stem. Example:

- *misit*: perfect tense, "He sent"
- *miserat*: pluperfect tense, "He had sent"
