# How to approach reading assignments

*Do*:

- analyze the structure of sentences and paragraphs.  You should confidently find the main clause of each sentence, and try to group the remainder of the sentence into verbal expressions
- after you have (slowly) worked through a passage the first time, come back to it a second time on another day, and read through it (more easily) once more.  You should look at a passage at least *twice* before class.
- bring questions to class!


*Never*:

- write out an English translation
- write English vocabulary glosses on your Latin text


*Feel free to*:

- make grammatical notes on a printout of your text. (Examples might include reminding yourself of the form of a verb or what principal part it comes from; grouping nouns and adjectives that go together, or that go with a preposition; linking subject-verb-object of a clause; noting constructions like indirect statements or circumstantial clauses.)
- make a separate vocab list of terms that occur in the assigned passage


## Resources you can use 


- passges of Hyginus [formatted and highlighted for syntax](../hyginus/)
- [Lewis and Short's *Latin Dictionary*](http://folio2.furman.edu/lewis-short/)
