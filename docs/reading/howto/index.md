# How to read your text

## General rules

- do **not** write out a translation!
- **do** write out your analysis of syntactic structure (step 1 below)
- **do** keep a vocabulary list: note the dictionary forms (e.g., for nouns, nom.s., gen,s. and gender; for verbs, principal parts) and a note on English meaning

## Process

1. Break each sentence into verbal units:
    - make a document in your github repository where you can use `>` to add levels of indentation.  (Remember to separate lines of text with a blank line between them.) This will be easy to read from and share screen in class with.
2.  Start with the syntactic "top" of the passage:  read all the *independent* (main) clauses to try to understand the flow of the narrative.  Context helps!
3.  Go back and start to add dependent (subordinate) clauses, level by level (reading levels left to right in your outline).  Add to your vocabulary list as you complete each sentence.
4. **Reread**! This is very important and often overlooked.  Before coming to class, try to read the passage a second time:  give yourself a 10-minute limit, and see how fast you can work through the passage.  (You might want to do this in the ten minutes before class begins.)
5. **Reread**!!  When you begin the next passage, start from the previous section.  E.g., if you're reading section 4 of chapter 30, start by rereading sections 2-3 of chapter 30 as you continue on to the new material in section 4.  This will solidify your work on the earlier material, and give you the context to continue.
