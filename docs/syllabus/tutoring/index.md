# Peer tutoring

The Department of Classics and the Classics Department Inclusion Committee offer a peer-based tutoring program for Latin 101 students. The tutors have received training through Academic Services and Learning Resources, and can discuss course with ou, help you understand how to solve problems, and suggest independent learning strategies. 

Tutoring workshops run as an appointment-based service of 40-minute sessions, at time arranged between you and the Peer Tutor. To set up an appointment with one of the tutors, please contact your professor.
