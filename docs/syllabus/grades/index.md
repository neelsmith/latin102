# Course requirements and grades

You determine your own course grade by satisfactorily completing a number of assignments in three categories:

1. written assignments for class preparation 
1. longer portfolio assignments 
1. work in CBL lab

All assignments will be graded satisfactory/unsatisfactory according to an explicit specification of requirements: if you complete all requirements for an assignment, the assignment is satisfactory; otherwise, it is unsatisfactory.




##  Class preparation

The course schedule includes fourteen brief assignments as part of your routine class preparation: one introductory Google form to complete, and thirteen  assignment to be submitted in writing. Each assignment can earn up to two points: one point for a completed *submission* by the specified deadline, and a second point for a grade of *satisfactory*. For written assignments, the deadline for initial submission 11:00 am on the due date, our class meeting time.  

If you submit an assignment on time (earning one point), but have an error, you may resubmit a corrected version as often as you like up until the deadline for final revisions for that course unit. When a revised submission is satisfactory a second point will be recorded for that assignment.

The total points you can earn in this category is 28.


## Portfolio assignments

Over the course of the semester, you will develop a portfolio of nine longer assignments. Three of these will demonstrate mastery of basic features of language; three will be analyses and translations of passages in Latin; three  will be compositions in Latin.  Throughout the semester, we will set aside class meeting time to workshop drafts of these longer assignments.

As with class preparation assignments, each portfolio assignment earns one point for a complete submission on time, and a second point if it fulfills all the requirements for a satisfactory grade. For portfolio assignments, the deadline for initial submission any time on the due date.  Like class preparation assignments, portfolio assignments may be revised as often as you like up to the deadline for revisions for each module. 

The total points you can earn in this category is 18.


## CBL lab

You will receive three grades for CBL lab work.


- preparatory assignment:  one preparatory assignment ("Identify that character") can earn up to two points: one point for a completed submission by the deadline, and a second point for a grade of satisfactory.
- participation: you will participate in a total of seven sessions with Worcester or Marlborough students.  Each session earns one point in this category.
- reflection: one brief reflection can earn up to two points: one point for a completed submission by the deadline, and a second point for a grade of satisfactory.

The total points you can earn in this category is 11.

## Determination of final course grade


Your course grade will be recorded from this table.  In the row for each grade, the numbers in each column represent the *minimum* number of points required in that category. For example, if you earn 18 points in in the portfolio category, 11 points in the CBL category and 25 points in the class preparation category, your course grade is A-.

| Course grade | Portfolio (out of 18) | Class preparation (out of 28) | CBL  (out of 11) |
