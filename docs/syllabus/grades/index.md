# Course requirements and grades

You determine your own course grade by satisfactorily completing a number of assignments in these categories:

1. portfolio assignments
1. written assignments for class preparation 
1. in-class assessment of specific features of language or vocabulary
1. CBL lab work

All assignments will be graded satisfactory/unsatisfactory according to an explicit specification of requirements: if you complete all requirements, the assignment is satisfactory.

Portfolio assignments, written homework assignments and in-class assessments may be repeated or revised as often as you like, up until a deadline for revisions thtat will be indicated on each assignment.  Normally, the deadline will be 3:00 pm on Friday of the following week.


## Portfolio assignments

Over the course of the semester, you will develop a portfolio of *up to 9* longer assignments. Three of these will demonstrate mastery of basic features of language by analyzing and explaining forms and constructions; three will be analyses and translations of passages in Greek; three  will be compositions in Greek.

Throughout the semester, we will set aside class meeting time to workshop drafts of these longer assignments.

Each portfolio assignment earns one point for a complete submission on time, and a second point if it fulfills all the requirements for a satisfactory grade by the deadline for revisions.  Portfolio assignments may be revised as often as you like, up to the deadline for revisions for each module. 

The total points you can earn in this category are **18**.


##  Written homework assignments

The course schedule will include *up to 6*  brief written assignments as part of your routine class preparation.  Each assignment can earn up to two points: one point for a completed *submission* by the specified deadline, and a second point for a grade of *satisfactory*. 

The specifications for these assignments are straightforward: a submission is satisfactory if all responses are correct; an error means that the assignment is not satisfactory. If you submit an assignment on time (earning one point), but have an error, you may resubmit a corrected version as often as you like up until the deadline for final revisions for that module. When a revised submission is satisfactory a second point will be recorded for that assignment.

For written assignments, deadlines for submission are *3:00 pm* the day *before* class.  

The total points you can earn in this category are **12**.

## In-class assessments

In addition to written preparation, we will have regular in-class assessments. *Up to 10* of these will focus on vocabulary; *up to 8* will focus on features of language or grammar.  

In-class assessments will always be announced ahead of time, and we will always do at least one practice version together at least one class before we have a graded in-class assessment.

In-class assessments earn up to two points, one point for completing the assessment, and a second point if all answers are correct.  You may retake these assessments as often as you like up until the deadline for retakes.  You may not retake an assessment that you have missed for an unexcused class absence.

The total points you can earn in this category are **20** for vocabulary assessments and **16** for language assessments.


## CBL lab


Beginning in February, you will participate in *up to 8* weekly CBL labs. We will continue the mythology curriculum we used in the fall semester with students in Worcester and Marlborough public schools.  


The total points you can earn in this category are **8**.


## Determination of final course grade



For each category, the preceding sections define the *maximum* number of assignments we will complete. If the daily course schedule changes and we instead work on fewer than the maximum number of assignments, you will receive full credit for any dropped assignments. For example, if we have 7 in-class language assessments instead of the maximum of 8, you will receive 2 points for the omitted assignment; that plus your points on the seven completed assignments would be your total for the semester in the category of language assessments.

Your course grade will be recorded from the following table.  In the row for each grade, the numbers in each column represent the minimum number of points required in that category.

| Course grade |  Portfolio (18) | Homework (12) | Vocab. assessments (20) | Language assessments  (16) | CBL participation |
