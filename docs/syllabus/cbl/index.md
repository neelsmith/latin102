# Community-based learning

Community-based learning (CBL) is an essential part of our course. In this part of the course, you will work under the supervision of a mentor with elementary and middle schoolers in Worcester and Marlborough on collaborative projects about the texts we are reading. (Note that we have already developed a curriculum you can use in this work). 

You should anticipate spending roughly two hours per week (including travel) on the CBL part of your course.  We have included that time in our course plans as part of the 8-10 hours weekly  that Holy Cross expects students to devote to work outside of our 150 minutes of meeting time.

Scheduling for off-campus work will be coordinated in conjunction with the CBL office during the first week of class.
