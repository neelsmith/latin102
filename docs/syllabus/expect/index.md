# What to expect 

This course builds directly on Latin 101. In the fall semester, you learned some of the most important, most distinctive and most frequent features of Latin. We covered that material at a fast pace -- and the winter break is long!  You will constantly reuse material from the fall semester, so it is important that you solidify your grasp of that material until you are confidently and readily able to apply it to your reading this spring.

We will introduce several new concepts in the weeks before Easter break.  Some may sink in immediately, and others may take more practice.  Review and practice are as important as your initial introduction to a topic, so every graded assignment offers you the opportunity to repeat it as often as you need in order to complete it satisfactorily.

After Easter, our class time will increasingly focus on reading of continuous passages of Hyginus' *Fabulae*. Throughout the semester, most of our class time together will be devoted to actively applying and using ideas from your class preparation. Since much of the value of this time results from your active engagement with course material, and cannot be replicated by passively watching someone else's involvement, I do not plan to record our class meetings.

## Tips

These practices will help you absorb material most effectively:

- Schedule regular times both for newly assigned homework and review of previously covered material.
- Spread your study across several days each week. Multiple, shorter sessions are better preparation than an equal amount of time in a single marathon.
- Practice your Latin aloud. Vocalizing Latin and listening to yourself will help you progress more rapidly than reading silently.
- When you are studying, focus only on Latin. Turn off your cell phone and any other electronic communications. Turn off any music: you should see, hear and speak only Latin.
