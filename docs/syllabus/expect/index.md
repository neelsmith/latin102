# What to expect 

There are no prerequisites for this course, and no individual concept we are going to cover this semester is particularly complex, but Latin 101-102 is a fast-paced sequence. At the beginning of the course, *everything* will be new, and you should expect that the hardest part of the entire 101-102 sequence will be the first few weeks before fall break, because everything will be new.  Our course is organized so that these weeks introduce the  most frequent features of the language, so as you constantly reuse the material from the beginning of Latin 101, it will not only become increasingly automatic, but will give you a framework that will make it easier to learn further features of the language.

Some concepts may sink in immediately, and others may take more practice.  Review and practice are as important as your initial introduction to a topic, so every graded assignment offers you the opportunity to repeat it as often as you need in order to complete it satisfactorily.


Most of our class time together will be devoted to actively applying and using ideas from your class preparation. Since much of the value of this time results from your active engagement with course material, and cannot be replicated by passively watching someone else's involvement, I do not plan to record our class meetings.

## Tips

These practices will help you absorb material most effectively:

- Schedule regular times both for newly assigned homework and review of previously covered material.
- Spread your study across several days each week. Multiple, shorter sessions are better preparation than an equal amount of time in a single marathon.
- Practice your Latin aloud. Vocalizing Latin and listening to yourself will help you progress more rapidly than reading silently.
- When you are studying, focus only on Latin. Turn off your cell phone and any other electronic communications. Turn off any music: you should see, hear and speak only Latin.



## Work log

To help you gauge how effectively you are managing your work, I will ask you to keep a log of your work on Latin. You should note what days you worked on Latin and for how long.  You may also wish to note what kind of work you did: written homework, vocabulary review, or draft of a portfolio assignment, for example.

Your work logs will not be graded, but I will periodically ask you to summarize the number of days and hours per week you have worked on Latin, for anonymous submission. This will help me evaluate how to balance assignments as we progress through the year.
