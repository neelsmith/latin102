# Goals

Latin 101 is the first semester of a two-semester sequence to introduce you to the study of Latin.  We will use a curriculum recently developed by several members of our Classics department at Holy Cross, led by [Professor Machado](https://dominicmachado.github.io). By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- identify ways that  language structures our understanding of the world we live in
- articulate how Latin has shaped and continues to shape structures of power in the modern world
- read and pronounce Latin with confidence and accuracy
- analyze syntax and sentence structure in Latin and English
- express complex ideas in written composition both in Latin and in English
- read authentic, unaltered Latin texts with minimal glossing
