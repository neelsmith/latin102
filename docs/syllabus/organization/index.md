## Textbook: REWRITE THIS

The fall semester course is organized in three units. On our course website, each unit identifies concrete objectives that will help you achieve the broader course goals summarized above.  The three units correspond closely to the first three units of the online textbook we are revising for this year's course.  You can always find a current on-line version at [https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/).


In addition to introducing new features of Latin, each unit will include reading that connects the topics you are studying to contemporary experience, and will conclude with a reading selection from an authentic ancient text.  This year, our reading selections will be drawn from a mythological handbook attributed to Gaius Julius Hyginus.

The textbook also has an accompanying youtube channel and playlist at [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyA2aidE3BiD3idsxrJr5Hg/videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyA2aidE3BiD3idsxrJr5Hg/videos).
