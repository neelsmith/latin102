# Organization of the course


## Textbook

The fall semester course is organized in three units. On our course website, each unit identifies concrete objectives that will help you achieve the broader course goals summarized above.  The three units correspond closely to the first three units of the online textbook we are revising for this year's course.  You can always find a current on-line version at [https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/).


In addition to introducing new features of Latin, each unit will include reading that connects the topics you are studying to contemporary experience, and will conclude with a reading selection from an authentic ancient text.  This year, our reading selections will be drawn from a mythological handbook attributed to Gaius Julius Hyginus.

The textbook also has an accompanying youtube channel and playlist at [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyA2aidE3BiD3idsxrJr5Hg/videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyA2aidE3BiD3idsxrJr5Hg/videos).

## Technologies and mechanics of submitting assignments

We will use three technologies for managing course material this year.


1. All course material will be available on the **course web site** at [https://neelsmith.github.io/latin101/](https://neelsmith.github.io/latin101/).
2. Grades will be recorded in **Canvas**. You can check Canvas to review your progress in completing graded assignments.
3. [**Github**](https://github.com/) is the world's most widely used service for hosting projects with *version control* -- that is, tracking drafts and modifications to documents.  We'll use github to collaborate on drafts of your class preparation and portfolio assignments. Every github repository also includes the option of hosting a free web site on `github.io`, so you'll have the choice of sharing your entire portfolio or selections from it on a publicly visible website. This can be valuable beyond Latin 101:  many employers now are accustomed to finding a link to a github site as a standard part of job applications.
