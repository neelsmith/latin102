## Monday, Feb. 22


Breakout 1: turn one complex sentence into two simple sentences:

- take each sentence [last Friday](../assignments/relative2/)'s exercise:  rewrite it as *two* sentences

1. rewrite  each sentence as *two* sentences

## Wednesday, Feb. 17


For your assigned sentence, decide:

- how will you organize your composition in clauses?
- every sentence has an independent clause: what tense and mood will you use?
- if your sentence includes a dependent construction, what construction will you use?
- find the principal parts of all verbs you plan to use


## Monday, Feb. 15

### Levels of subordination

For each of the following two sentences:

- place each clause on a separate line
- prefix each clause with a `>` for each level of subordination.

1. Hyginus says that Hercules killed Neleus when Neleus refused to purify him.
2. When Deianira realized that Neleus had tricked her, she sent Lychas, who had given the poisoned garment to Hercules, to bring it back before he could put it on, but she was too late.


### Composing relative clauses

The following pairs of simple English sentences (that is, a single independent clause) have a noun in common. Combine them into one complex sentence by keeping the first sentence as the independent clause, and making the second sentence a relative clause.


1. After Hercules killed Megara and their sons, Neleus was not willing to purify Hercules.  Neleus was then killed. 
2. Hercules stole the Delphic tripod.  Jupiter ordered the tripod to be returned to Apollo.
