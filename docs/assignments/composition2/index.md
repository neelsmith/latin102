# Composition: Hercules and Megara


## Background story

> After Hercules had been sent by King Eurystheus to fight Cerberus (the three-headed dog guarding the gates to Hades), Lycus, the son of Neptune, thought that he Hercules had died. As a result, Lycus wished to kill Megara, the daughter of Creon and Hercules’ wife, and their two sons, Therimachus and Ophis, so that he could take his kingdom. When Hercules learned this, he quickly went to Lycus and killed him. Because of his evil deed, Hercules was punished by Juno, the wife of Jupiter. The goddess possessed his mind and Hercules killed Megara and his sons. In the aftermath of this event, Hercules did not wish to live and subsequently was given into slavery by Mercury.
