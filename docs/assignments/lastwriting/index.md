## Final writing assignment

Your final assignment will be a brief discussion of a passage of Hyginus.  You may choose any of the [four passages linked here](./passages/).


You may discuss the passage from any one of the following prompts.  Whichever topic you choose to focus on, be sure to support your discussion with specific references to the Latin text of Hyginus.  

Prompts:

1. Ask ChatGPT or Bard to translate the Latin text of the section you have selected into English.  Analyze the resulting translation. Identify sections you think are especially good or that you would adopt in translating the passage.  Also identify sections you think are not as good or flat out wrong. Suggest one or more ways to translate that you would prefer.
2. Analyze Mary Grant's published translation of the section of Hyginus. Identify sections you think are especially good or that you would adopt in translating the passage.  Also identify sections you think are not as good or flat out wrong. Suggest one or more ways to translate that you would prefer.
3. Ask ChatGPT or Bard to translate the Latin text of the section you have selected into English. Compare the resulting English text with Mary Grant's published translation. Identify sections where they arrive at similar results, and sections where they differ.  Explain which translation you prefer and why.
4. Compare the Latin text of Hercules with any modern version of Hercules stories that you know of. You may refer to all of Hyginus' narrative of 32-36 from your reading in English translation, but your discussion of the passage you select should include reference to the Latin text of Hyginus.  You may contrast the selection and narration of stories about Hercules, but in discussing the Latin text of the selected passage, you should also consider *how* Hyginus' Latin tells the story.
