# Review: verbs


## 1. Common compound verbs

The following eleven verbs are verb common in all Latin texts.  In addition, many compounds are built on them: if you learn these verbs thoroughly, you will recognize a very large number of Latin verbs.


Using [this review list](../../review/verbs1/), memorize the four principal parts for each verb:

- capio
- do
- duco
- eo
- facio
- fero
- mitto
- pono
- sum
- venio
- volo

Two of the compounds formed from the irregular verbs *sum* ("to be") and *volo* ("to wish") may seem less obvious.  *Possum* "to be able" is from *pot* + *sum*;  *nolo* "*not* to wish, to be unwilling" is from *non volo*.  If you know the forms of *possum* and *volo*, you will have no trouble recognizing forms of *possum* and *nolo*.

## Part 2: other common verbs

Each of these verbs appears frequently in Hyginus (48 or more times!)  If you recognize their principal parts automatically, you will read the *Fabulae* much more easily.

- **First conjugation**: appello
- **Second conjugation**: habeo, video, respondeo, jubeo
- **Third conjugation**: peto, nascor, pario
- **Fourth conjugation**: audio
