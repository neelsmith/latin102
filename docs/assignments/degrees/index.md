# Comparative and superlative degree

In addition to *gender, case* and *number*, adjectives have a fourth grammatical property: *degree*.  We have been working with Latin adjectives of the *positive* degree; they may also be *comparative* or *superlative*.  English adjectives have a similar property: "good" expresses the positive degree, "better" the comparative degree and "best" the superlative degree.

In you textbook, read the sections on

- the [comparative degree](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/2021-2022/20-degree/comp-adjs/)
- the [superlative degree](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/2021-2022/20-degree/superl-adjs/)

Be sure you know:

- what declension patterns do the comparative and and superlative use?
- what are 2 ways to express with the comparative that one noun is *more X than* another?
