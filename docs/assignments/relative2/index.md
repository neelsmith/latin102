# Practice with relative clauses


In class today, we'll practice reading some Latin relative clauses.  Review the following sentences, and for each relative pronoun:

1. find its antecedent, and identify the gender and number
2. identify the case of the relative pronoun, and explain *why* it is in that case

1. Hercules in Aegypto Busiridem, qui hospites interficiebat, necauit.
2. Hercules Licham qui uestem attulerat in mare iecit.
3. Eurytum cuius filiam eius in coniugium petiuit occidit.
