# Reviewing noun-adjective agreement



## Background: thematic noun lists

More than 75 nouns appear 15 or more times in Hyginus.  That's too many for us to learn at one sitting, so we'll break the list of nouns [here](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/vocabulary/nouns/) into thematic groups, such as "family terms", "animals", "warfare" or anything else you would find helpful.


## 1. Defining a theme

Define a theme of your choosing that includes at least four nouns in the [list of most frequent nouns in Hyginus](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/vocabulary/nouns).


In your github repository, list the nouns belonging to your theme in the file `nouns1.md` that we created together in class.

## 2. Finding forms

Use the search box below to find all the distinct forms of each word that actually appear in Hyginus.  For example, if you choose `aper1` ("wild boar"), you'll see that it appears in only two forms:  `apro` and `aprum`.

Edit your file `nouns1.md`, and for each noun in your theme, list all the forms that occur.  Fully identify each form (gender, case, number).

  ## 3. Noun-adjective agreement

  Choose one noun in your list, and then choose one adjective from the (short!) list of [most frequent adjectives in Hyginus](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/vocabulary/adjectives/).

  If your noun is a first or second declension noun, choose a third declension adjective;  if your noun is a third declension noun, choose an adjective with first and second declension forms (a "2-1-2" adjective).

  For all the forms of your noun that appear in Hyginus, write out the noun-adjective pair, and add that to your `nouns1.md` file.
