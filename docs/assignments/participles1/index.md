# Participles

## Background

We've looked at several kinds of verbal expression:

- *main clauses* using the indicative mood with subject in the nominative caase
- *subordinate clauses* introduced by a conjunction (like *cum*), or a relative pronoun, using either the indicative or subjunctive mood with subject in the nominative case
- *indirect statement* using an infinitive with subjcet in the accusative case


## Participles as verbal expressions

*Participles* are a further kind of verbal expression. Participles may have exactly the same kinds of objects or predicates as finite verb forms (e.g., a transitive verb could take a direct object).  

The relation of the participle to the subject of the verbal action is expressed differently than the other verbal expressions we've seen, however. The participle is always linked to a noun or pronoun in the clause; this noun or pronoun functions as the subject of the participle’s action.

This means that participles can never stand alone as a verbal unit: they express an additional verbal idea, attached to another word in the clause. In English, we most commonly express this kind of dependent verbal unit using a subordinate clause – that is, a clause with its own finite verb form, but one that cannot stand by itself as a complete sentence.


Although English has some verb forms we refer to as “participles,” the most important difference conceptual difference between them and Latin participles is that Latin participles express a verbal idea  comparable to an English subordinate clause.




⚠️ This means you will normally *use an English subordinate clause to express the meaning of a Latin verbal expression with a participle*.



## Identifying and forming participles


Like finite verb forms, the form of participles indicate the tense and voice of the verbal action. Like adjectives, they agree in gender, case and number with a substantive functioning as the subject of the verbal action. The grammatical term "participle" reflects this: they share some of the properties of a finite verb (tense, voice), and some of the properties of an adjective (gender, case, number). When you fully identify the form of a participle therefore you should give its tense, voice, gender, case and number.

We will focus on two participles: the perfect passive participle, and the present active participle. The voices have exactly the same meaning as in finite or infinitive forms: in the active voice, the subject performs the action of the participle; in the passive voice, the subject receives the verb's action. The tenses differ in meaning in much the same way that the perfect indiciative and imperfect indicative differ: the perfect participle views the  action as a single, completed whole; the present participle  sees the action as repeated, ongoing, incomplete or in some other way not a single, whole action.


## Forms of the participle: perfect passive

You already know the forms of the perfect passive participle!  It's simply the fourth principle part.  You have previously seen the fourth part used with forms of *sum* to create finite verb forms in the perfect passive  (e.g., *interfectus est*, "he was killed*) or infinitives in the perfect passive (e.g., *interfectum esse*). Recall that its forms are regular 2-1-2 adjectives, like *bonus, bona, bonum*.



## Forms of the participle: present active

The present active participle uses third-declension endings, with a single set of endings for all genders (a *one-termination* adjective).

Use the second principal part to find the stem. The nominative singular is the stem + *-ns*; the genitive singular is the stem + *-ntis*.  The genitive singular form tells you this is a third-declension adjective: the stem for the remaining forms will end in *-nt-*.

### Finding the stem

First, second and third conjugations: drop the final *-re* from the second part:

1. laudāre > laudans, laudantis
2. monēre > monēns, monentis
3. duco > ducens, ducentis


For third-io verbs and fourth conjugations verbs, drop the *-re* from the second part and change the final vowel to *-ie-*:

- capere > capiens, capientis
- audire > audiens, audientis


## Meaning of the participle

In its most frequent usage, the participle's verbal expression describes circumstances surrounding the main action.  Consider an example from Hyginus' story about a time when Hercules was angry at the god Apollo, and stole Apollo's tripod from the sanctuary at Delphi.

Here's the basic sentence: 

> *Hercules de fano eius tripodem tulit*.
> 
> Hercules carried his (Apollo's) tripod away from the sanctuary.


Hyginus adds the participle *iratus* (fourth part of the verb *irascor*, "to be enraged"), to give us

> *Hercules iratus de fano eius tripodem tulit*.


*iratus* agrees with *Hercules*, so he's the subject of the verbal idea.  What is the connection between the idea "Hercules was enraged" and "Hercules took the tripod"?  Unlike a subordinate clause that specify that idea with a conjunction, the participle leaves the exact relation open.  We could take it as "After he grew enraged, he took the tripod" or (perhaps better) "Because he was enraged, he took the tripod."  The participle does not exclude either possibility -- and even allows us to understand both ideas at the same time.

Englis can't do anything exactly like this, so to translate a Latin participle in English, you'll have to make a choice.






*Hercules iratus de fano eius tripodem tulit*.
