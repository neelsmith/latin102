# Nouns in 5 declensions


Although the overwhelming plurality of Latin nouns belong to the three declensions you already know, Latin has a total of five declensions.  
This week, we will learn the few nouns of the *fourth* and *fifth* declensions that occur several times in Hyginus.



## Fifth declension



Like the second declension, fifth-declension nouns have a genitive singular ending in **-i**;  you can tell them apart by looking at the nominative singular, since the fifth declension regularly shows the ending **-es**.  Learn  these three very important nouns, and 
refer to the paradigms of fifth-declension nouns in the L3 textbook [here](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/reference/nouns-paradigms/#fifth-declension-masculinefeminine) to figure out how they decline.

- dies, diei *m*: day
- fides, fidei *f*: faith
- res, rei *f*: thing, matter, affair


## Fourth declension

Fourth-declension nouns have a genitive singular in **-ūs**.  Refer to the paradigms of fourth-declension nouns in the L3 textbook [here](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/reference/nouns-paradigms/#fourth-declension-masculinefeminine).  How many possibly forms can end in **-us** for masculine or feminine nouns of the fourth declension?  for neuter nouns?

Learn these four fourth-declension nouns:

- currus, currūs, *m*: chariot
- domus, domūs, *f*: house, home
- genu, genūs, *n*: knee
- impulsus, impulsūs, *m*: (striking against), influence, instigation
