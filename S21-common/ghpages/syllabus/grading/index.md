# Course requirements and grading


## MWF course work

Graded work will be organized in four modules.  Each of the first three modules includes a quiz or assessment exercise, a translation and grammatical analysis of a Latin passage, and a Latin composition.  In a final section of the course, we will


You will post your submissions to a github repository where I can read and share comments with you. You will have the option of using github to host your entire portfolio or selections from it on a personal web site.



## CBL lab

You will participate in regular lab sessions conducted by an alumna or alumnus of last year’s Latin 101/102 course. You will receive credit for successfully:

- attending all scheduled meetings
- completing a creative group project to engage with students in Worcester Public Schools


## Grading

You will determine your own course grade this semester. We will use specification grading, a system that makes criteria for earning course points explicit in a shared rubric.

Each assignment is worth two points: if it is submitted *on time*, you receive one point.  If it is *satisfactory*, you receive a second point.

- assignments are *on time* if they are submitted by the due date on the course checklist of assignments, or by a different date you have arranged with me.
- assignments are *satisfactory* if all specified requirements are met.
