> Background: *Telephus was wounded by Achilles, and was told by an oracle that he could only be healed by the same spear that wounded him.  He can't get that from Achilles, so he tries a little hostage taking.*

From Hyginus section 101:

>hoc Telephus ut audiuit, ad regem Agamemnonem uenit et Orestem infantem rapuit, minitans se eum occisurum nisi sibi Achiui mederentur.
