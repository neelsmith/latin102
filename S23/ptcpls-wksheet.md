### Avoid using participles to express circumstances in English

The Second Amendment to the US Constitution:

> A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.



### What kinds of circumstance can a Latin participle express?

How would you interpret the participial phrase `dicens id` if the main clause of the Latin sentence expressed the ideas listed below?  Note that *dicens* is masculine nominative singular, so it is comparable to a clause with the same subject as the subject of the main sentence.

1. He did something else.
2. He inspired them to act.
3. He suddenly collapsed.
